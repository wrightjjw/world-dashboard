# world-dashboard
The world dashboard is a web project to help people stay up to date on the state of a world.
It is aimed at usage for tabletop roleplaying games
to help a game master keep track of their world as time moves on,
and for players to be able to understand current world details at a glance.

## Project Goals
[ ] Provide an interface for users to see details about the current daily state of the world,
including weather, season, sunrise and sunset.
[ ] Have the world attributes randomly but reasonably progress when a day passes.
[ ] Give a world admin the ability to set world parameters and to advance the calendar.
[ ] Allow multiple worlds in one app instance.
Allow the webmaster to give world admin priviledges to other users.
